      summary: Get Connected Client Businesses
      description: 'Retrieve a list of client businesses connected to the specified application.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Monitor application-business client relationships

        - Verify connected business configurations

        - Retrieve business connection status and details

        - Manage client business access and permissions



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Caching:**

        Business connection data can be cached for moderate periods, but status information may change.

        Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      summary: Create Multi-Partner Solution
      description: 'Create a new Multi-Partner Solution that defines permission distribution between

        a solution owner app and a partner app for WhatsApp Business messaging collaboration.



        **Permission Logic:**

        - Only one partner (owner or partner app) can have MESSAGING permission

        - At least one partner must have MESSAGING permission

        - Both partners automatically receive default solution partner permissions

        - Empty permission arrays indicate no configurable permissions for that partner



        **Solution Lifecycle:**

        - Solutions are created with INITIATED status

        - Require subsequent activation workflow through solution management

        - Can be managed through Partner Dashboard or solution management APIs



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply with WhatsApp Business Management throttling.

        Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff for rate-limited requests.



        **Validation:**

        - Partner app must be accessible and have proper capabilities

        - Permission combinations are validated against business logic rules

        - Solution names must meet length and content requirements

      summary: Get Multi-Partner Solutions for Application
      description: 'Retrieve all WhatsApp Business Multi-Partner Solutions associated with the specified application.

        This includes both solutions owned by the application and solutions where the application

        acts as a partner.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Retrieve all solutions for an application''s portfolio management

        - Filter solutions by ownership role (owner vs partner)

        - Monitor solution lifecycle and status changes across multiple solutions

        - Verify solution configuration before business onboarding operations

        - Check pending approval requests and status transitions



        **Filtering:**

        Use the `role` parameter to filter solutions by the application''s relationship:

        - `OWNER`: Only solutions owned by this application

        - `PARTNER`: Only solutions where this application is a partner

        - No role parameter: All solutions (both owned and partnered)



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Caching:**

        Solution details can be cached for short periods, but status information may change

        frequently during transitions. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      summary: Get Pre-Verified Phone Numbers
      description: 'Retrieve pre-verified phone numbers available for use with the specified business.

        This endpoint provides information about phone numbers that have been pre-verified

        and are ready for immediate use with WhatsApp Business messaging operations.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Retrieve available pre-verified phone numbers for business messaging setup

        - Check verification status and availability of phone numbers

        - Monitor pre-verified phone number inventory

        - Validate phone number options before WhatsApp Business Account configuration

        - Facilitate quick business messaging setup with pre-verified numbers


        **Filtering and Pagination:**

        - Results can be filtered by verification status, availability, and country

        - Cursor-based pagination is supported for large result sets

        - Default page size is 25 items, maximum is 100 items per page


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        Phone number information can be cached for short periods, but availability status

        may change frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      summary: Onboard Partners to MM Lite
      description: 'Send a request from the partner to onboard an end business to MM Lite.

        This creates a business agreement request and sets OBO mobility intents

        on eligible WhatsApp Business Accounts.



        **Business Flow:**

        1. Validates partner business and app permissions

        2. Checks end business eligibility for MM Lite

        3. Identifies eligible shared WABAs and OBO WABAs

        4. Sets mobility intents on eligible OBO WABAs (BSPs only)

        5. Creates business agreement request

        6. Returns request ID for tracking



        **BSP vs TP Behavior:**

        - BSPs (Business Solution Providers): Can create OBO WABAs and set mobility intents

        - TPs (Technology Partners): Can only create onboarding requests, no OBO WABA management



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Subject to business partner integrations use case throttling limits.

        Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Idempotency:**

        If a pending request already exists between the same partner and end business,

        the existing request ID is returned instead of creating a duplicate.

      description: 'Retrieve WhatsApp Business Accounts owned by the specified business. This endpoint

        provides comprehensive information about all WABAs owned by the business, including

        account details, configuration, and status information.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Retrieve all WhatsApp Business Accounts owned by a business

        - Filter accounts by business type

        - Find specific accounts by ID

        - Monitor business portfolio of WhatsApp Business Accounts

        - Manage account access and permissions across multiple WABAs


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        Account information can be cached for short periods, but status and configuration

        may change frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      summary: Share Pre-Verified Phone Number with Another Business
      description: 'Share a pre-verified phone number with another business entity, granting specified

        permissions for collaborative WhatsApp Business messaging operations.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Enable partner businesses to use your pre-verified phone numbers for messaging

        - Share phone number resources between parent and subsidiary businesses

        - Facilitate multi-business WhatsApp integrations with shared phone number access

        - Establish temporary or permanent phone number sharing relationships



        **Business Logic:**

        - Only businesses with appropriate ownership or sharing rights can share phone numbers

        - Shared phone numbers maintain original ownership while granting usage permissions

        - Multiple businesses can have access to the same phone number with different permission levels

        - Sharing relationships can be time-limited with automatic expiration



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Validation:**

        - Pre-verified phone number must exist and be accessible to the requesting business

        - Target business must be a valid and accessible business entity

        - Requested permissions must be valid and within the scope of allowed sharing permissions

        - Sharing operation must comply with business relationship and access control policies

      description: 'Send encrypted messages using JWE (JSON Web Encryption) format. This endpoint provides an additional layer of security on top of existing standard TLS/SSL by accepting pre-encrypted message payloads and returning encrypted responses.


        **Important Notes:**

        - Only successful responses will be encrypted

        - Error responses will be returned unencrypted if the underlying JSON is incorrectly formatted

        - Payload encryption must be enabled for the phone number using the `POST /<WABA_ID>/settings` endpoint

        - The encrypted payload must follow the same structure as the original `/messages` endpoint


        **Prerequisites:**

        - User Access Token with `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission

        - Valid `Phone-Number-ID` for your registered WhatsApp Business account

        - Payload encryption enabled for the phone number

        - Properly formatted JWE token containing encrypted message payload using supported algorithms

        - Monitor OBA application progress

        - Retrieve status messages for business account verification

        - Validate business credibility status


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        OBA status information can be cached for moderate periods, but status may change

        during verification processes. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      description: 'Update or modify the Official Business Account (OBA) status for a WhatsApp Business Account phone number.

        This endpoint allows businesses to submit new applications, withdraw existing applications, or resubmit

        after addressing rejection reasons.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Submit initial Official Business Account application

        - Withdraw pending OBA application

        - Resubmit OBA application after addressing rejection feedback

        - Update application data for pending applications


        **Application Data Requirements:**

        When submitting or resubmitting an OBA application, certain business information may be required

        depending on the current status and previous submissions.


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply with additional restrictions on application submissions

        to prevent abuse. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Status Transitions:**

        - Applications can only be submitted when no active application exists

        - Withdrawals are only allowed for pending applications

        - Resubmissions are only allowed after rejection

      description: 'Deregister a WhatsApp Business phone number from the Facebook Hosted System.

        This operation removes the phone number from the WhatsApp Business Platform

        and makes it available for re-registration if needed.



        **Important Notes:**

        - Phone number must be currently linked in Facebook Hosted System

        - Phone number must be registered on the WhatsApp Business Platform

        - Cannot deregister phone numbers associated with SMB accounts

        - Rate limiting is enforced to prevent abuse

        - Deregistration triggers activity logging for audit purposes



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply with additional restrictions for registration

        operations. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Caching:**

        Deregistration status changes are immediate and should not be cached.

      summary: Get WhatsApp Business Account Message History
      description: 'Retrieve paginated message history for a WhatsApp Business Account phone number,

        including delivery status events, timestamps, and webhook update information.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Track message delivery status and events

        - Monitor webhook delivery and update states

        - Retrieve historical message delivery information

        - Debug message delivery issues and webhook failures



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Caching:**

        Message history data can be cached for moderate periods, but delivery status events

        may change frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.



        **Pagination:**

        This endpoint supports cursor-based pagination. Use the `after` and `before` cursors

        from the response to navigate through results.

      summary: Register WhatsApp Business Phone Number
      description: 'Register a WhatsApp Business phone number for messaging capabilities and enable

        two-step verification. This is a required step before sending messages through

        the WhatsApp Business Cloud API.



        **Registration Process:**

        1. Phone number must be in UNVERIFIED status

        2. Provide a 6-digit PIN for two-step verification

        3. Optionally provide backup data for account migration

        4. Registration activates messaging capabilities



        **Migration Support:**

        For migrating from on-premises WhatsApp Business API, include backup data

        with password and encrypted account information.



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Registration attempts are rate-limited to prevent abuse. Standard Graph API

        rate limits apply with additional restrictions for registration endpoints.



        **Security Requirements:**

        - Two-step verification is mandatory for all registered numbers

        - PIN must be securely stored and managed by the business

        - Registration enables webhook delivery and message sending capabilities

        This is the first step in the phone number verification process.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Initial verification of newly added phone numbers

        - Re-verification when phone number status requires it

        - Switching between SMS and voice verification methods


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Additional rate limiting may be enforced

        for verification code requests to prevent abuse.


        **Security:**

        Verification codes are sent only to the registered phone number and expire

        after a short time period. Multiple failed attempts may result in temporary blocking.

      description: 'Verify a phone number verification code for a WhatsApp Business Account phone number.

        This endpoint is used to complete the phone number verification process by submitting

        the verification code received via SMS or voice call.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Complete phone number verification during initial setup

        - Verify phone number ownership for messaging capabilities

        - Finalize phone number registration process

        - Complete phone number migration verification



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Verification attempts are rate-limited to prevent abuse. Failed attempts may result

        in temporary blocking. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Security:**

        Verification codes are time-limited (typically 10 minutes) and single-use.

        Multiple failed attempts may trigger additional security measures.

        This endpoint returns the public key that is currently configured for encrypting

        message payloads and indicates whether the stored signature is valid or has a mismatch.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Verify current encryption configuration

        - Check public key signature validation status

        - Retrieve public key for client-side encryption setup

        - Monitor encryption key status for security compliance


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        Public key information can be cached for moderate periods, but signature status

        may change and should be checked regularly for security validation.

      summary: Set Business Encryption Public Key
      description: 'Upload and configure a business public key for message payload encryption.


        This endpoint accepts a business public key in PEM format, validates it,

        and stores it with a cryptographic signature for future use in encrypting

        message payloads and data channel requests.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Initial setup of encryption for WhatsApp Business messaging

        - Update existing public key for key rotation

        - Enable secure payload encryption for sensitive business communications

        - Configure encryption keys for compliance requirements


        **Key Requirements:**

        - Must be a valid RSA public key in PEM format

        - Key must meet Meta''s security standards for encryption

        - Only one active public key per phone number at a time

        - Previous keys are replaced when new ones are uploaded


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Key uploads may have additional

        security-related rate limiting to prevent abuse.

        - Track detailed message delivery status events and transitions

        - Monitor delivery status occurrence timestamps

        - Retrieve application information for delivery events

        - Debug message delivery issues and status changes



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Caching:**

        Message history events can be cached for short periods, but delivery status events

        may change frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.



        **Pagination:**

        This endpoint supports cursor-based pagination. Use the `after` and `before` cursors

        from the response to navigate through results.

      summary: Request Verification Code for Pre-Verified Phone Number
      description: 'Request a verification code for a pre-verified phone number via SMS or voice call.

        This is part of the WhatsApp Business Account onboarding process where pre-approved

        phone numbers must be verified before they can be used for messaging.



        **Process Flow:**

        1. Call this endpoint to request a verification code

        2. User receives code via SMS or voice call

        3. Use the verify_code endpoint to complete verification

        4. Phone number becomes active for messaging



        **Rate Limiting:**

        - Limited number of code requests per phone number per time period

        - Exponential backoff recommended for retry attempts

        - Voice calls may have additional restrictions



        **Language Support:**

        Verification messages are sent in the specified language when available.

        Falls back to English (en_US) if the requested language is not supported.



        **Security Considerations:**

        - Codes expire after a short time period

        - Limited number of verification attempts allowed

        - Phone number must be pre-verified and owned by requesting business

        - Complete phone number verification during WhatsApp Business onboarding

        - Verify ownership of phone numbers for business messaging

        - Enable phone numbers for WhatsApp Business API usage



        **Rate Limiting:**

        This endpoint has specific rate limits to prevent abuse:

        - Standard Graph API rate limits also apply



        **Code Validation:**

        - Codes are time-sensitive and expire after a set period

        - Each code can only be used once

        - Invalid or expired codes will result in verification failure



        **Error Handling:**

        - Invalid codes return 400 Bad Request

        - Expired codes return 422 Unprocessable Entity

        - Rate limit exceeded returns 429 Too Many Requests

        **Use Cases:**

        - Obtain secure access tokens for partner applications to access customer business resources

        - Enable multi-tenant partner architectures with dedicated tokens per customer business

        - Support secure API operations on shared WhatsApp Business Accounts

        - Implement proper security boundaries between different customer businesses



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Token Management:**

        Access tokens are time-limited and should be refreshed before expiration. Store tokens securely and implement proper token rotation strategies.

        This endpoint completes the partner approval workflow by accepting a deactivation request

        that was previously initiated by another solution partner. Upon successful acceptance,

        the solution status transitions from ACTIVE to DEACTIVATED, and the pending request

        status changes from PENDING_DEACTIVATION to NONE.



        **Important Business Logic:**


        - Solution must be in ACTIVE status with PENDING_DEACTIVATION pending status


        - All outstanding payments and invoices must be settled before acceptance


        - Active marketing campaigns must be concluded or transferred


        - Webhook notifications will be sent to all solution partners upon completion


        - Solution resources and permissions will be cleaned up according to policy

      summary: Accept Multi-Partner Solution Invitation
      description: 'Accept an invitation to participate in a Multi-Partner Solution as a partner application.

        This endpoint transitions the partner''s status from NOTIFICATION_SENT to ACCEPTED,

        enabling the solution to progress toward ACTIVE status once all required partners accept.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Accept partnership invitations for Multi-Partner Solutions

        - Activate partner participation in existing solutions

        - Confirm partner app''s commitment to solution terms and conditions

        - Enable solution workflow progression from INITIATED to ACTIVE status



        **Business Logic:**

        - Only invited partner apps can accept solution invitations

        - Solution must be in INITIATED status to accept partnerships

        - Partner status transitions from NOTIFICATION_SENT to ACCEPTED

        - Solution may become ACTIVE once all required partners accept

        - Acceptance creates formal partnership agreement between apps



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Validation:**

        - Partner app must have received a valid solution invitation

        - Solution must exist and be accessible to the partner app

        - Partner app must have proper permissions and capabilities

        - Acceptance request must include valid partner app identification

      summary: Reject Multi-Partner Solution Deactivation Request
      description: 'Reject a pending deactivation request for a Multi-Partner Solution. This endpoint allows

        solution partners to decline deactivation requests from solution owners, maintaining the

        solution in its current active operational state.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Reject deactivation requests from solution owners

        - Maintain active solution partnerships when deactivation is not appropriate

        - Respond programmatically to deactivation requests through API integration

        - Keep solutions operational when business requirements or partnerships change



        **Business Logic:**

        - Solution status remains ACTIVE after successful rejection

        - StatusForPendingRequest transitions from PENDING_DEACTIVATION to NONE

        - All existing solution configurations and permissions are preserved

        - Solution partners receive notifications about the rejection decision



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Permissions:**

        Requires whatsapp_business_management permission and valid solution partnership relationship.

      description: 'Reject a pending partnership request or deactivation request for a Multi-Partner Solution.

        This endpoint allows solution owners to decline incoming requests and maintain control

        over their solution partnerships and lifecycle.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Reject partnership requests from unauthorized or incompatible applications

        - Decline deactivation requests to keep solutions active

        - Maintain solution security and partnership quality

        - Control solution access and collaboration boundaries



        **Request Types:**

        - `PARTNERSHIP_REQUEST`: Reject an incoming partnership request from another app

        - `DEACTIVATION_REQUEST`: Reject a request to deactivate the solution



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Business Logic:**

        - Only solution owners can reject requests for their solutions

        - Partnership rejections require the partner_app_id parameter

        - Rejection actions are permanent and cannot be undone through this API

        - Rejected requests may need to be resubmitted through proper channels

      summary: Send Multi-Partner Solution Deactivation Request
      description: 'Submit a deactivation request for a Multi-Partner Solution. This initiates

        a workflow to transition the solution from its current state to deactivated,

        following proper business validation and approval processes.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Request deactivation of an active Multi-Partner Solution

        - Initiate solution lifecycle transition management

        - Trigger business workflow for solution deactivation approval

        - Programmatically manage solution lifecycle states



        **Business Logic:**

        - Solution must be in ACTIVE or INITIATED state to be eligible for deactivation

        - Deactivation requests are processed asynchronously

        - Solution status will transition to PENDING_DEACTIVATION during processing

        - Final deactivation requires business approval workflow completion



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Workflow:**

        1. Validate solution ownership and permissions

        2. Check solution eligibility for deactivation

        3. Submit deactivation request to business workflow

        4. Return confirmation with tracking identifier

        - Check verification and approval status

        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        Account number details can be cached for short periods, but status information may change

        frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

        - Retrieve user permission assignments for compliance

        - List all users with access for management purposes

        - Monitor user access patterns and assignments



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Caching:**

        User assignment data can be cached for short periods, but permission changes may occur

        frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      summary: Remove User from WhatsApp Business Account
      description: 'Remove a user''s access from the WhatsApp Business Account. This operation revokes

        all permissions and access rights for the specified user on the account.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Revoke user access when they leave the organization

        - Remove temporary access grants

        - Clean up user permissions for security compliance

        - Manage user lifecycle and access control



        **Important Notes:**

        - This operation removes ALL permissions for the user on this WhatsApp Business Account

        - The user will lose access to all account features and data

        - This action cannot be undone - the user must be re-added if access is needed again

        - Webhooks may be triggered to notify of user access changes



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.

      summary: Create OBO Mobility Intent
      description: 'Create a new On-Behalf-Of mobility intent for a WhatsApp Business Account.

        This endpoint allows authorized solution providers to initiate mobility operations

        on behalf of business accounts, facilitating transfers and handovers between

        different solution providers.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Initiate account mobility process between solution providers

        - Request handover of account management

        - Schedule mobility operations for future execution

        - Coordinate multi-partner solution transitions



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Mobility Process:**

        1. Create mobility intent with appropriate intent type

        2. System validates mobility eligibility and permissions

        3. Intent enters PENDING status awaiting approvals

        4. Partner notifications and approval workflows are triggered

        5. Upon approval, mobility operation is scheduled or executed

        6. Status updates are provided throughout the process

      description: 'Retrieve all phone numbers associated with a WhatsApp Business Account, including their

        status, verification details, and configuration information.


        **Use Cases:**

        - List all phone numbers in a WhatsApp Business Account

        - Monitor phone number status and verification progress

        - Check phone number quality ratings and messaging limits

        - Retrieve phone number configuration details


        **Filtering:**

        You can filter results using the `filtering` parameter with JSON-encoded filter conditions.

        Supported filters include account_mode, messaging_limit_tier, and is_official_business_account.


        **Sorting:**

        Results can be sorted by creation_time or last_onboarded_time in ascending or descending order.


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        Phone number data can be cached for short periods, but status information may change

        frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      summary: Create WhatsApp Business Account Phone Number
      description: 'Create a new phone number registration within a WhatsApp Business Account. This endpoint

        initiates the phone number onboarding process, including verification and business name approval.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Add new phone numbers to a WhatsApp Business Account

        - Migrate phone numbers from on-premises to Cloud API

        - Register pre-verified phone numbers for BSP scenarios

        - Initiate phone number verification and business name approval process


        **Prerequisites:**

        - WhatsApp Business Account must have available phone number slots

        - Phone number must not be already registered with WhatsApp Business

        - Business must meet WhatsApp Business API requirements

        - Appropriate permissions and app review completion


        **Process Flow:**

        1. Submit phone number and business name for registration

        2. Phone number verification code will be sent (if not pre-verified)

        3. Business name will be submitted for review

        4. Monitor status through GET endpoint until approval


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Phone number creation is subject to strict rate limits to prevent abuse.

        Standard Graph API rate limits also apply.


        **Migration Support:**

        Set migrate_phone_number=true when migrating from on-premises API to Cloud API.

        Additional validation and migration-specific logic will be applied.

      summary: Set Solution Migration Intent
      description: 'Set migration intent for a Multi-Partner Solution associated with a WhatsApp Business Account.

        This endpoint allows solution partners to initiate, schedule, confirm, or cancel migration

        processes for their solutions.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Initiate migration process for solution transitions

        - Schedule migration for a specific time

        - Confirm pending migration requests

        - Cancel previously set migration intents



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Migration Process:**

        1. Set migration intent with INITIATE_MIGRATION

        2. System validates migration eligibility

        3. Migration intent enters PENDING status

        4. Partner can schedule or confirm migration

        5. Migration executes at scheduled time or immediately upon confirmation

        **Use Cases:**

        - Monitor which apps are subscribed to WABA webhook events

        - Audit subscription configurations and permissions

        - Verify subscription status before making changes

        - Retrieve subscription details for troubleshooting



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.



        **Caching:**

        Subscription data can be cached for short periods, but may change when apps

        subscribe or unsubscribe. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      description: 'Subscribe your application to webhook events for the specified WhatsApp Business Account.

        This enables your app to receive real-time notifications for events such as message

        deliveries, status updates, and other WABA activities.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Enable webhook notifications for your app

        - Configure custom callback URLs for webhook delivery

        - Set up webhook verification tokens for security

        - Override default app webhook settings for specific WABAs



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Subscription operations may have additional

        throttling to prevent abuse.



        **Security:**

        Always use HTTPS endpoints for webhook callbacks. Verify webhook authenticity

        using the provided verification tokens and signature validation.

      summary: Unsubscribe from WABA Webhooks
      description: 'Unsubscribe your application from webhook events for the specified WhatsApp Business Account.

        This will stop your app from receiving webhook notifications for this WABA.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Disable webhook notifications when no longer needed

        - Clean up subscriptions during app decommissioning

        - Temporarily disable webhooks for maintenance

        - Remove subscriptions for WABAs no longer managed by your app



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Unsubscription operations are typically

        processed immediately.



        **Important:**

        Unsubscribing will immediately stop all webhook deliveries for this WABA.

        Ensure your application can handle the cessation of webhook events gracefully.

      description: 'Retrieve activity logs and audit trails for a WhatsApp Business Account.

        This endpoint returns a chronological list of activities performed on the account,

        including administrative actions, configuration changes, and operational events.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Monitor account configuration changes and administrative actions

        - Generate compliance and audit reports for regulatory requirements

        - Track user activities and permission modifications

        - Investigate security incidents and unauthorized access attempts

        - Monitor API usage patterns and operational events


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        Activity data can be cached for short periods, but recent activities may change

        frequently. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

        configuration, status, and settings.


        **Use Cases:**

        - Retrieve WhatsApp Business Account configuration and details

        - Monitor account status and verification state

        - Check account ownership and business information

        - Validate account state before messaging operations


        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.


        **Caching:**

        Account details can be cached for moderate periods, but verification status may change.

        Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

      description: 'Update the WhatsApp Business Profile information such as business description, email, address,

        and other profile details. This operation corresponds to the GraphWhatsAppBusinessProfilePost functionality.



        **Use Cases:**

        - Update business profile information and metadata

        - Modify contact details and business description

        - Change business vertical classification

        - Update website URLs and profile picture

        - Maintain current business profile information



        **Profile Picture Upload:**

        It is recommended to use the Resumable Upload API to obtain an upload ID, then use this

        upload ID to obtain the picture handle for the `profile_picture_handle` field.



        **Rate Limiting:**

        Standard Graph API rate limits apply. Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff.
